## **Introduction**

Hey team! ðŸš€

I had an exciting chat with the folks over at **Hip Hop, Pizza, and Wangs**. They've been a staple in our community for over 30 years, and guess what? They've seen our LinkedIn post about offering app development services to small businesses. This is a golden opportunity for us!

## **Client Background**

The concept of HHP+W is all about the fusion of music and food. Think about it â€“ old school hip hop, delicious pizza, wings, and a chilled beverage. Their clientele mainly consists of urban professionals aged between 25-45. Plus, it's not just a restaurant; it's an art scene for artists who resonate with the hip hop culture.

Since the 2020 pandemic, they've adapted to the new normal by offering call-in orders. And with a recent Facebook ad, their phones haven't stopped ringing! But here's the catch â€“ they're still using a pencil and paper method to track orders. That's where we come in.

## **Objective**

They're looking for a POS (point of sale) application tailored for tablet devices. This will help streamline their order process and enhance customer experience. And the best part? We get to build it!

## **MVP Features**

The MVP for the POS system for **Hip Hop, Pizza, and Wangs** will include the following key features, refined to align with our detailed discussions and ticket descriptions:

1. **User Authentication**: Secure login for staff using Firebase Auth to ensure authorized access to the POS system.
2. **Home Screen Display**: A welcoming interface post-login, offering options to view and create orders, and check revenue.
3. **Comprehensive Order Management**:
   - **View All Orders**: Access to a detailed list of all orders.
   - **Order Details and Associated Items**: Ability to view specific details and items for each order.
   - **Create and Update Orders**: Functionality to add new orders and modify existing ones, including customer details and order type.
   - **Delete Orders and Order Items**: Options to remove orders or specific items from the system.
4. **Order Item Management**:
   - **Add Order Items**: Capability to include new items to orders. While adding items to an order, menu items will be displayed for selection. However, there will be no functionality for creating, editing, or deleting menu items available to the cashier.
   - **Update and Delete Order Items**: Update details like name and price of order items, and remove specific items from an order.
5. **Closing and Revenue Tracking**:
   - **Close Order with Restrictions**: Feature to finalize orders with payment type and tip amount, changing order status from "Open" to "Closed".
   - **Revenue Node Addition**: Automatic creation of a revenue node upon order closure, capturing essential financial details.
   - **View Total Revenue**: Ability to view the cumulative revenue generated.
6. **Feedback System**: A platform for customers to leave reviews and ratings, enhancing the customer experience.

These features are designed to streamline the order process, enhance customer interaction, and provide a comprehensive overview of the business's financial health, with specific attention to the management of order items and revenue tracking.

## **Next Steps**

I've jotted down the main points, but I'll be setting up a follow-up meeting to dive deeper into the specifics. I'll keep you all posted. Let's gear up and make this a success!
