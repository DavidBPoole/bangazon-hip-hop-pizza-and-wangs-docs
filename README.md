## Planning and Implementation Guidelines

While we trust your expertise and creativity, we've outlined some guidelines to ensure the project aligns with the client's vision:

- Prioritize the MVP: Before diving into the stretch goals, ensure the MVP is fully functional and tested.

- Comprehensive Wireframes: We have created wireframes that illustrate the user journey and interactions within the platform. These wireframes provide a visual representation of our intended user interface and guide our design and development efforts.

- Database Design (ERD): We have designed a database schema (Entity-Relationship Diagram) that maps out the relationships between different entities in our system. This ERD helps us organize and structure our data effectively.

- Project Board: Our project board serves as a central hub for planning, organizing, and tracking our progress. Each ticket represents a specific task or feature, allowing us to assign responsibilities, set milestones, and monitor our progress as we bring the Bangazon E-commerce Platform to life.

- Collaboration and Communication: We will utilize GitHub Discussion Tickets for seeking assistance, discussing project-related topics, and keeping track of our planning process. This collaborative approach ensures efficient communication and allows the team to provide guidance, support, and feedback throughout the project.

- Coding Standards: We will adhere to the community-accepted coding guidelines. This includes following consistent naming conventions, documenting classes and methods with clear comments, using proper indentation, and maintaining clean and readable code.


## Planning Process Tracking

The Senior Engineer has created a set of tickets to help you track your progress and ensure a systematic approach to the planning tasks. These tickets are designed to guide you through the essential steps of the planning process and provide checklists for tracking subtasks within each item.
